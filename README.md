# ![Hairbrush Social](images/hairbrushlogo.svg)
A retro-styled social network that is decentralized and respects your privacy.

Hairbrush is a hard fork of unmaintained [Bwitter](https://github.com/yukiqt/bwitter), a clone of 2007 Twitter.

## Features
* Compatibility with ActivityPub and Twtxt, as well as the dead simple [NBlog](https://github.com/fazlabz-dev/nblog) spec.
* Markdown formatted posts.
* Emoji support via [Twemoji](https://twemoji.twitter.com/).
* Customized version of the [Tweet button](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-for-websites/tweet-button/overview) without JavaScript and with modified styles to fit Hairbrush's look and feel.
* Slightly improved and rewritten codebase.
